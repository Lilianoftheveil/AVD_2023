Camilo Repository

First of all, I saved all html5 files of books of the Camilo Castelo Branco found in "https://www.gutenberg.org/" 
and rename each one by the title of them, putting "_" to replace " " in a paste.
After, I did and used a script "html_md.py" to convert all html files in that paste to md files.
But, all dm files had on the first line a text about the conversion of that files.
So I wrote the script "delete_first.py" to open all md files and remove the first line of them.
